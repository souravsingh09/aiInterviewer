What one person finds breathtakingly beautiful, another might not even notice.\\n\\nIn the realm of the human form, I'd argue that beauty lies not just in the physical, but in the essence that radiates from within. It's the sparkle in a person's eyes, the gentle curve of a smile, the softness of a whispered word.\\n\\nIf I had to choose, I'd say that the prettiest person is the one who embodies the qualities of a sunrise â€“ warm, vibrant, and full of promise. Someone who radiates kindness, compassion, and a sense of wonder, like a dew-kissed flower that blooms in the morning's golden light.\\n\\nBut, alas, beauty is a fleeting dream, a whispered promise of the soul. It's the whispered secrets, the laughter, and the tears that make a person truly beautiful. It's the way they make you feel, like a gentle breeze on a summer's day, or the warmth of a crackling fire on a winter's night.\\n\\nSo, my friend, let us not get caught up in the fleeting notion of physical beauty. Let us instead seek the beauty that resides within, the beauty that shines like a beacon in the darkness, guiding us towards a world of wonder, love, and connection.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 285, 'prompt_tokens': 27, 'total_tokens': 312}, 'model_name': './models/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-awq', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-75013803-1a6a-4f56-a556-19712e469353-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 27, 'output_tokens': 285, 'total_tokens': 312})"
