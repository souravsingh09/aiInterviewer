Interviewee: Hello
Interviewer: Hello Jobin Mathew, welcome! My name is Clarissa, and I'll be conducting your interview today. Could you please introduce yourself, share your total years of experience, your current company, and some of the notable projects you've worked on?
Interviewee: I have a total of five years of experience with two of them as a Python developer. I'm presently working at Tech Mahindra for the past two years. Most of the projects I have worked on are machine learning and deep learning related, with my most recent project being an attrition prediction project.
Interviewer: That's great to hear about your experience and projects, Jobin. Can you tell me more about the attrition prediction project you mentioned? What was the dataset used, and which machine learning algorithms did you employ to achieve the desired results?
Interviewee: So the data set was provided to us by the HR department of our company and what they wanted us to do was to predict which employee had a chance of leaving the company or at writing. So for this we had various data points such as what were the last hike that was provided was for the present grade of the employee and what was the rating provided to the employee in the previous review cycles. So for this implementing this we use the machine learning model of.Random forest algorithm.
Interviewer: Okay. Please elaborate on how you handled the imbalanced dataset, considering that the number of employees leaving the company might be significantly less than those staying.
Interviewee: So this is a classic case of imbalance data set. So in order to resolve this imbalance, we undersampled the majority class and oversampled the minority class. So by doing this, we were able to bring the data set ratio of classes to 60 and 40 and we were satisfied with the balance here. So that's how we handled the imbalance.
Interviewer: Okay. How did you evaluate the performance of your Random Forest model, considering the class imbalance issue you just mentioned? What metrics did you use to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score?
Interviewee: So we did not perform any sort of evaluation to test our model. What we did was we went directly to the business team and we asked them to evaluate whether they were satisfied with the result that were coming and they said that they were satisfied with the results. That is why we did not do any sort of evaluation at our end.
Interviewer: Okay. Can you walk me through how you implemented the CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI and GitHub Actions for your machine learning projects?
Interviewee: Sorry, I'm not aware of any CICD pipelines. Uh, that because I do not know about this.
Interviewer: Okay. Let's move on to the topic of AI. Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Interviewee: So supervised learning is the learning when a supervisor is present, when the model is being run and unsupervised. A model which does not require any sort of human supervisor to perform its actions. So an unsupervised model can be utilized without any human presence, but a supervised machine learning model requires a human presence.
Interviewer: Okay. Can you provide an example of a real-world scenario where you would use unsupervised learning, and how it would help in that scenario?
Interviewee: Please end the interview.
Interviewer: Jobin Mathew, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I appreciate your honesty about your experience and skills. Someone will be in touch with you regarding the outcome of this interview. Have a great day!
